## Text editor

### What is it?

A text editor is software that is a place for you to type in your code or syntax so that it may eventually be compiled and expressed as a desired webpage, in our specific situation. What is specific about a text editor for coding is that it explicitly deals with plain text and not rich text that may have graphic treatments to them.

### Why is it important?

Having the right text editor is important because it is the basic work area you will be spending a majority of your time looking at and using. It is important to be comfortable and familiar with the functions and features so that you can be quick and effective with your ideas as you put them on screen. You don't want to hinder bringing to life your thought processes because you have a less than ideal (for you) text editor.

### What are some features of a good text editor?

- free (why not?)
- easy to install
- widely supported
- syntax highlighting
- extensions
- themes, if wanted (especially for me, sensitive to certain lighting conditions)
- and importantly, code completion

### Which will we use?

In this course of study, I believe it will be important for us to use Visual Studio Code by Microsoft because it seems very user friendly and visually effective in highlighting syntax and linter errors, you directory structures, and having a preview window accessible.
