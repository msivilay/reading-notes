<p> This article was written about the findings of a study done of Google teams called Project Aristotle, led by Julia Rozovsky, an MBA graduate from Yale. She found that all teams had unspoken and common norms. Those could vary widely from group to group but it was important to be able to identify those and see how that medium was expressed through employee action.

It was found that successful teams had equality in verbal contribution or 
‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’ The turn taking may have been done in different amounts depending on the task, but in totality, everyone had spoken roughly the same amount. This contributed the overall team cognitive intelligence to increase.

Secondly, ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ was a key indicator of how well teams functioned. This is very true in all forms or human relationships. It is important to read those social and indirect cues. The best teammates were sensitive to one another’s moods and share personal stories and emotions. It is was found important to connecting to share a struggle, because it allows everyone to let their guard down.

The combination of these two are called "psychological safety" and it is the ‘‘shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking.’’ Psychological safety is ‘‘a sense of confidence that the team will not embarrass, reject or punish someone for speaking up,’’ This is important to feel safe and secure in your contributions to the team environment.

To no surprise, it was found that micromanaging decreased overall feeling of satisfaction and effectiveness. Other key behaviors were important were that teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But psychological safety, was the most important trait.

This makes sense because in any relationship that can be viewed as a team, whether it is at work, a marriage, a family, or a interest-based team, it is important to feel seen and valued for your contribution, and thus, you have to be able to give your contribution in a safe manner. "Emotional interactions and complicated conversations and discussions of who we want to be and how our teammates make us feel — that can’t really be optimized." In essence, you need to care about your team members as individuals that have mutual goals and can feel free to contribute their unique skills and personality as a whole.

I believe that this topic can be applied almost every thing in life and it is extra important in the workplace environment because we spend so much of our time there and being progressive, productive people in a personal sense will lead to productivity in the workplace.
