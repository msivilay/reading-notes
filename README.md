# Marina Sivilay - Code Fellows: Read Me
I am required to create this 'Reading Notes' repository for my coursework at Code Fellows.

## Course 102 Lab 01b Assignment:


**_On the main page:
Explain “growth mindset” in your own words_**

_Growth Mindset_ is a term that encompasses a flexible thought pattern and process. It is typically defined by embracing challenges and seeing obstacles as opportunities for growth and learning. It seems equally important to consider that a _Growth Mindset_ does not make any assumptions, or at least attempts to lessen them. _Growth Mindset_ is a way to describe that all effort is worthwhile. Through hardwork, perseverence, and an open attitude all things are possible.


**_Include 3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset_**
```
Reminders:

1. I will re-evaluate my thought process when frustrated with a problem.
2. I will be honest with my struggles and utilize my coding peers and community to help me navigate the issues.
3. I will be grateful for all feedback that is given.
```

**_Utilize at least 5 different features of Markdown to structure your page_**
- Header (various levels)
- **Use** _of_ `typographical emphasis` or <sub>text</sub> <sup>styling</sup>
- Highlighted block
- This bulleted list, and numbered list above
- Link to email
<!-- - Use of a hidden comment :wink: -->
