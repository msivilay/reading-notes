Assignment: _Go through these resources, and create a page in your reading-notes repo that summarizes the topics you learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it._

Dear friend,
<br><br>
Markdown is a _syntax_ that allows you add styling and features to your page. 
_Syntax_ is a set of rules for the arrangement of characters in a language to be able to express something meaningful.

There are multiple features that Markdown uses to express things like text styling.
Here are some examples of text styling or typographical emphasis, and the correct syntax that corresponds with the desired effect.

Example: **I want this entire sentence to be in bold.**

You would type:
```
**I want this entire sentence to be in bold.**
```
<sup>Notice the use of two asterisks (*) both before and after the desired words.</sup>

Example: _I want this entire sentence to be in italics._
```
_I want this entire sentence to be in italics._
```
<sup>Notice the use of one underscore (_) both before and after the desired words.</sup>

Example: ~~I want this entire sentence to be striked out.~~
```
~~I want this entire sentence to be striked out.~~
```
<sup>Notice the use of two tildes (~) both before and after the desired words.</sup>

It also allowed me to create the highlighted gray boxes above to delineate information or to show the actual code one needs to type into the editor.

There are a multitude of text treatments you can do with the Markdown syntax and a great way to get started is by using this resource: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax

This is just a glimpse of what I am starting to learn at Code Fellows. It's my first day and I already have pages on Github. I hope you enjoyed and understood this little summary of my what I am doing in the program.
