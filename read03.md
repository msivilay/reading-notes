## Git and GitHub - personal summary

Are they the same thing? No.
GitHub is a cloud-based platform to house public and private repositories from which you can pull. It has many features that can keep track of commits and pulls but essentially acts as a storage for much of the code repositories out there.

Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) which is a decentralized way to store various versions of code so that it allows easier simultaneous workflow for collaboration. It was invented by Linus Torvalds for the complexity that was needed for Linux code submissions. It is can be used to clone repositories to your local git repository where upon you would **add, commit, and pull (and push)** various files and code changes to GitHub.
