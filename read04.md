### Wireframe

What is a wireframe? A bare bones or the key elements of a design. It's a quick draft of main design elements desired for each page.
There are two basic types of wireframes: Physical hand-drawn sketch or Digital tools can be used. Digital ones allow you to collaborate with others more easily. It also is easier to see the visual output for the end user.
It's important to use a wireframe to plan the information on the screen and examine user flow.

### HTML

HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language and it is used to create the structure of your pages. It essentially defines the structural elements to your content. It utilizes opening `<example`> and closing `</example>` tags to define the elements that it is encapsulating. Therefore, we can later apply styles to those structural elements. Which leads us to...

CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets. This applies different stylistic elements to your html structures. It allows for keeping continuity and brand presence for your site. You can make all headers one color for example, and paragraphs in another color. 

The functional structure is called a ruleset. They consist of: a Selector (html structural element), Declaration (the style property rule), Properties (different features of the selector), and Property Value (the value you chose for the particular property).

```Markdown
For example:
p {
  color: red;
}
```

There are so many things you can adjust, for example backgroud color, size of fonts, margins, etc.

### Semantics

Semantics, just as in the language arts, is what gives syntax and characters meaning. They are important to help categorize and clarify parts of the code to be understood by multiple players.

These are some examples of semantic elements*:

```Markdown
- <article>
- <aside>
- <details>
- <figcaption>
- <figure>
- <footer>
- <header>
- <main>
- <mark>
- <nav>
- <section>
- <summary>
- <time>
```
