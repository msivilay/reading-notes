## CSS - summary

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a type of syntax, or simple set of language rules, used to create and determine styling for your html file. It can add wonderful styling to your html structure and skeleton. It allows for quick treatment to html elements for consistency and efficiency.

It can be used in three main ways:
- External CSS
- Internal CSS
- Inline CSS

**External** is where a separate CSS file is referenced to the html document.

Example: `<link rel="style_sheet" href="mystyles.css">`

**Internal** is when you utilize the  `<style>` `</style>`  tags as shown.

**Inline** is when you utilize a style attribute in size an html element or tag

`Example: <h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">I am a happy heading.</h1>`

It is probably best practices to utilize an external source so that it is better organized.
