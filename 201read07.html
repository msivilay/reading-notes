<p> Domain Modeling
  <br>
  <br>

  Domain modeling is important because it helps create a consistent environment that adheres to a particular structure or aesthetic while simultaneously being dynamic and adaptive to the changing environment or needs of your site or workspace.

  HTML Table Basics
  <br>
  <br>
  Why should tables not be used for page layouts? Tables are not necessarily configurable to adapt the changing landscape of the webpages. They are a more rigid block element.
  <br>
  <br>
  List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML. <br>
  <br>
  Header, Main, and Footer to me are the most basic and common semantic elements because it really denotes the natural structure of a story or even something anthropomorphic like websites are sometime described as. The header, pretty much announces the general topic of entirety of the content. Main is what would hold the most dynamic elements, where the DOM manipulation will mostly occur. And the footer is something that will probably stay continuous and static on most pages of your project.

  Introducing Constructors
  <br>
  <br>
  What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it? <br>
  <br>
  A constructor is a kind of method that is used to initialize objects. It is called when an object of a class is created.
  
  <br>
  How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor? <br>
  <br>
  THIS when used in an object literal is very specifically and referring to the local object and will not change. I’m not exactly sure of the difference. Or at least how to explain it.
  <br>
  <br>
  Object Prototypes Using A Constructor
  <br>
  <br>
  Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
  <br>
  <br>
  A prototype is an object that is being connected to a function or functions to be able to create more modifiable  object properties and methods. It allows the reach or access to the function across multiple objects instead of having to work only on one and it not be applicable to changing needs or additions.
