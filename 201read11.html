<p> Video and audio content is more prevalent and relevant in today’s society. It is important to know how to utilize these tools on your project to be more effective with user engagement.
</p>
<h2>Video and Audio Content</h2>

<p>1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
  They have become part of the HTML standard. It used to be all proprietary plug-ins and things like Real player, shockwave, and flash.
 <br><br> 
  2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the < video> element. 
  The src attribute contains the path of the video you want to embed. The controls attribute is important to have because it allows the user to have controls over the media content, most critically for accessibility issues. At a minimum, it must be able to start and stop the media and adjust the volume.
  <br><br>
  3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the < video> element?
  First, it can help adapt to older browsers where the video may not be playable. It is similar to the alt text for an image, someone might be using a non video capable browser and it is another avenue to addressing accessibility issues.
  <br><br>
  4. Write a very short story where < audio> and < video> are characters:
  Audio said to Video “Hey buddy, I would like to be just like you, except I don’t want the picture component and I want to take up less space on the page.” Video said, “So you don’t want to support the width, height, or poster attributes?” “Nope!” snickered Audio, “I don’t have a visual component remember?”

  <br><br>
  2. Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.
  A Grid container is the parent of all the grid items and is the element where display is. Grid items are the children of the grid container and where the content occurs. Grid lines are the line divisions that build the grid.

<h2>Responsive Images</h2>
1.  Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive? It can help to save bandwidth, and you can show, not just the resized image, but a crop that might be more fitting for a smaller screen or even a completely different image.
<br><br>  
2. Define the following < img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.  Srcset is a set of srcs that are separated by commas for a variety of possible image choices. Sizes is a list also separated by comma to include different sizing options. The browser can load a small one quickly and then load the higher resolution one in the background. 
<br><br>
3.  How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript? Images are preloaded in CSS and JavaScript before adjusting to page size.
