  <h2>HTML Forms</h2>
<p> Why are forms so important in web development? Forms are important because it is the portal to which the user can provide input to the client and thus form a more meaningful space and interaction. It can also update the information on the current page in that same session, therefore upping user engagement.
  When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience? Definitely, considering accessibility should be on the forefront of all design but especially forms as the layout and content can really keep out large sets of population. Important to be readable. Be short.
  List 5 form elements and explain their significance
 *input> The typical element is the area where you are asking for the input to be held. It's designed to be one line.
  *label> Gives the input area a name
  *select> Defines a drop down list
  *textarea> This is just a multi-line input area.
  *button> This is what calls an action to the inputted information.

<p>How would you describe events to a non-technical friend? Basically it is when something happens to an HTML element. When an action is involved.
  When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide? two parameters: the name of the event we want to register this handler for, and the code that comprises the handler function we want to run in response to it.
  Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful? 
  What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?. Capture means capturing phase – the event goes down to the element. Target phase – the event reached the target element.Bubbling phase – the event bubbles up from the element.
