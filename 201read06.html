<h1>JavaScript Object Basics</h1>

How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

  An object is like a structural casing that houses multiple properties of that structure. 
<br>
<br>
What are some advantages to creating object literals?

  It allows for much easier calling and understanding to the properties you wish to manipulate. Also, it is less confusing than calling to individual indices in a typical array.
<br>
<br>
How do objects differ from arrays? 
  
  Objects store their values as a set of key-value pairs and are generally more easily accessible to information because arrays rely upon calling of the indices.
<br>
<br>

Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

  You would need to use bracket notation when the key of the key pair is a string with spaces in it, like console.log(axel['favorite cat food']);
<br>
<br>

Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
  The "this" refers to the name and age of this particular object, and not to be confused with any other global variables.
<br>
<br>
What is the DOM? The DOM is a standard to viewing the document as an object and thus configurable with object methods.
<br><br>
  Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript. The DOM is able to utilize JavaScript to essentially create html dynamically without having to explicitly edit by hand the original document. It allows the document to become essentally and object in itself and create new elements as demanded.
