	Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.
	
	Yo, through the HTTP protocol, resources are exchanged between client devices and servers over the internet. Client devices send requests to servers for the resources needed to load a web page; the servers send responses back to the client to fulfill the requests. Requests and responses share data such as images, text, and text layouts put together by a client web browser to display the full web page file.  – By M. Sivilay
	
	Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.
	
	The browser begins parsing the HTML from an external server and uses this to look for CSS and scripts that are needed to render the webpage. The browser continues to parse the HTML code while sending requests to the server for the CSS and JavaScript files. Next, the browser parses the CSS and js files. With the parsed code, a DOM tree is made with the HTML, a CSSOM tree is made with the CSS, and JavaScript code is compiled and executed. The browser then applies the styles from the CSSOM to the DOM and executes JavaScript to show a visual representation of the code to a user.
