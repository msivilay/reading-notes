  Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error. Syntax error will halt execution of the program. Logic error will produce perhaps faulty results, it could lead to infinite loops or memory exhaustion.
  <br><br>
  List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them. I noticed a lot syntax errors. Basically, having someone look at it while I'm working and tell me that something was missing or I had a typo. Ooh, I really mess up the back tick and single quotation all the time. If I don't mix them up, I will forget them. Can't win. 
  <br><br>
  How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals? I imagine that this will be all consuming in my future work. I think that we all strive to make perfect products off the bat, but it is important to have ways to tests oneself for accuracy and logic. I believe it will ultimately what we spend the most time on in the future when we have careers.

<h3>The JavaScript Debugger.</h3>

<p>
  How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development? The example reference given was about the Developer tools that are inherent in the Google Chrome browser. It has a lots of stuff in it, one of the things it has is a JavaScript debugger. It allows you to control the running of the program, you can pause it, you can examine the state of the variables, and continue execution and see what happens.
  <br><br>
  Define what a breakpoint is. A breakpoint is a place in the program to pause or stop execution in order to examine it.

  What is the call stack? It's the set of function calls that have led to this point or currently in progress.
